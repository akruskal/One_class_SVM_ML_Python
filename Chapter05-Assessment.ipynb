    "Suppose that we have a data set in which one class (e.g. malignant) is so underrepresented that there isn't enough data to fit a two-class classifier. Imagine that this is a very rare type of cancer and we do not have many cancer cases (malignant tumours) to obtain samples, and therefore, we do not have enough samples of malignant tumours <font color=red>**to train**</font> our algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, imagine that we have no images available of malignant tumours to train our model, only bening cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In **anomaly detection** one approach to solve our problem is as follows: \n",
    "1. Learn the distribution of the normal cases, benign cases in this example. Thus, we train our model with benign cases ONLY.\n",
    "2. For newly incoming data, compare how well these fit with the learnt model. The newly incoming data will have both, benign and malingnant cases.\n",
    "3. As the model has been trained to identify ONLY benign cases, everything that is not benign in the final model, will be classified as \"not benign\", thus malignant. Therefore, we have to test our model with benign and malingnant cases in order to assess its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is an algorithm which proposes the tumours which are least likely to be normal. If datasets are large but anomalies are very few, this could save the doctor a lot of time. \n",

    "Other applications of this approach could be\n",
